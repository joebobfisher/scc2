FizzBuzz
--------
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for numbers that are a multiple of 3 print the word "Fizz" instead, and likewise for numbers that are a multiple of 5 print the word "Buzz" instead. This implies that if a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the word "FizzBuzz" should be printed.
