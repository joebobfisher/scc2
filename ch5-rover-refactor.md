_Clean Code_ Chapter 5: Formatting
----------------------------------
* The purpose of formatting
* Vertical formatting
    * The newspaper metaphor
        * Detail should increase as you move downward in the code
    * Vertical openness between concepts
    * Vertical density
    * Vertical distance
        * Variable declarations
            * Local variables should usually appear at the top of each function
        * Instance variables
            * Should be declared at the top of the class (Java)
            * Should be declared at the bottom of the class (C++)
            * Just follow a convention that won't surprise others!
        * Dependent functions
        * Conceptual affinity
    * Vertical ordering
* Horizontal formatting
    * Horizontal openness and density
    * Horizontal alignment
    * Indentation
    * Dummy scopes
* Team rules
    * Create and obey rules as a team!

Rover Obstacles Kata
--------------------

Furthering our rover work from past katas, we're going to apply the formatting rules we learned in Chapter 5 to our rover code. So no new features this time around -- just change your code to line up with the new formatting rules you've learned!
